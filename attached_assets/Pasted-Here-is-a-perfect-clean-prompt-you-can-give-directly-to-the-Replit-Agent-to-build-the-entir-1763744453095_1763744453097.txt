Here is a **perfect, clean prompt** you can give directly to the **Replit Agent** to build the entire feature fast.

# ✅ **PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT**

**Build a new feature in my existing React + Node backend project: an “Underrated Places Submission” page with automatic verification.**

### **Feature Requirements**

1. Create a new frontend page:
   **`UploadPlace.tsx`** inside `src/pages/`
   Fields:

   * Photo upload
   * Location input (GPS or address converted to coordinates)
   * Title of place
   * Description

2. Create a backend route:
   **POST `/api/places/submit`**
   This should accept:

   ```json
   {
     "title": "",
     "description": "",
     "latitude": "",
     "longitude": "",
     "image": "<uploaded file>"
   }
   ```

3. Add **three verification checks (automatic)**:

   ### **A. EXIF Location Check**

   * Extract EXIF GPS from the uploaded image
   * Compare distance with user-submitted location
   * If distance > 500m → mark as `pending_review`

   ### **B. Reverse Image Search**

   * Use any free API or placeholder logic
   * If the image is found online → reject

   ### **C. AI Fake Image Detection**

   * Use a simple open API or placeholder
   * If AI probability > 70% → mark as `pending_review`

4. **Final Decision Logic**:

   ```
   IF (EXIF matches <= 500m) AND (Reverse search = not found) AND (AI fake score < 70%) 
       → status = "verified"
   ELSE 
       → status = "pending_review"
   ```

5. Save into in-memory storage (or create a new storage file):

   ```
   id, title, description, coords, imageURL, status, createdAt
   ```

6. Return JSON response:

   ```json
   {
     "message": "Place submitted",
     "status": "verified" | "pending_review"
   }
   ```

7. Add a button in the Navbar to navigate to `/upload-place`.

### **Deliverables**

* Full frontend page
* Backend route + verification logic
* Updated router + storage
* Example placeholder verification logic
* Full code implemented inside my project

If you want, I can also write a **Bubble-compatible** version or a **more advanced AI version**.
